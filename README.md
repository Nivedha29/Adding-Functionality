## Blog Functionality

A modern blog application built with React and Vite, designed to demonstrate core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for blog posts. The project uses React Router for navigation, Axios for data handling (API calls or local JSON), and standard React hooks for state management and lifecycle control.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a foundation for building a complete blog platform. It allows users to:

View a list of all blog posts

View individual post details

Create new posts

Edit or delete existing posts
